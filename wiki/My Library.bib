	abstract = {Every conceivable corner of the Internet is jammed with reactions to the attacks, and September11 .archive.org is an attempt to corral the Net's wildly diverse contents into a central research repository. The project is a collaboration among the Library of Congress; the nonprofit Internet Archive, which is building a vast digital library at archive.org; and webArchivist.org, an academic research project financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The creators of the archive are developing a ”Webscape” feature that, by the end of the month, should enable visitors to assemble an annotated list of select pages ― for instance, the most poignant fire department memorial sites ― and share it with friends via e-mail. Steven M. Schneider, co-director of webArchivist.org and a political-science teacher at the SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome, said, ”I think of the archive as a canvas, and I want to give people the tools to paint their impressions.” Both Mr. [Robert R. Macdonald] and Ms. [Diane Kresh] acknowledged that their endeavors provided a way to cope with the tragedy. Mr. Macdonald said the New York meeting with his peers was therapeutic, and Ms. Kresh said mounting the \$100,000 archiving project was ”also a way to work through it emotionally and intellectually.”},

In this paper Bush proposed MEMEX, a device where information and records could be stored and linked together through 'trails' and 'associations' rather than 'artificial' indexing mechanisms. This idea is credited with being the inspiration, and precursor, for the modern World Wide Web (WWW) invented by Tim Berners-Lee, but as Harper notes, for most of the article, Bush was not concerned solely with the technical aspects of his MEMEX system. Instead, as with most computer visionaries, he was more concerned with how the computer system and its interfaces could help humanity [3]. We must therefore consider if, as a research field, we are still trying to build MEMEX as Bush envisioned it, or are we more influenced by a vision of information storage and presentation, of which Bush's paper was one of many?},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current state of web archiving in Australia, and how libraries are adapting their services in recognition of the expanding role that online material plays in their collections.

Design/methodology/approach – The National Library of Australia is the lead institution for digital archiving and preservation in Australia. Its PANDORA Archive has been the repository for archived web resources in Australia for over ten years and is a mature but continually developing system. The archival management system PANDAS that underpins the Archive, is as of 2007, in its third major revision. Other web archiving activities also now include annual Australian Domain Harvests and the usage of Archive-It, both of which are conducted in conjunction with the Internet Archive.

Findings – For many years it was considered that archiving could only ever completely capture a small, albeit representative, sample of the internet. Today the gap between what is available and what can be archived is decreasing. But as our archives and our archiving abilities increase, we are still confronted by new technologies and Web 2.0 applications.

Originality/value – Using as an example the 2007 Federal Election in which a large number of interactive sites such as Kevin07, MySpace and YouTube were archived the paper shows how Australian web archivers continue to adapt to and meet new challenges.},

Using a survey of over 3,500 18- to 24-year-olds contacted immediately prior to the Iowa caucuses, we illustrate that although SN Web sites are recognized by youth as a possible source of news and that many receive some of their news from these sites, the types of news gathered probably do little to inform them or add to democratic discourse. Moreover, the study shows that in spite of the promise SN sites hold for increasing political interest and participation among a chronically disengaged cohort, users are no more inclined to participate in politics than are users of other media.

	abstract = {Context.— The rapid growth of the Internet has triggered an information revolution of unprecedented magnitude. Despite its obvious benefits, the increase in the availability of information could also result in many potentially harmful effects on both consumers and health professionals who do not use it appropriately.Objectives.— To identify instruments used to rate Web sites providing health information
on the Internet, rate criteria used by them, establish the degree of validation
of the instruments, and provide future directions for research in this area.Data Sources.— MEDLINE (1966-1997), CINHAL (1982-1997), HEALTH (1975-1997), Information
Science Abstracts (1966 to September 1995), Library and Information Science
Abstracts (1969-1995), and Library Literature (1984-1996); the search engines
Lycos, Excite, Open Text, Yahoo, HotBot, Infoseek, and Magellan; Internet
discussion lists; meeting proceedings; multiple Web pages; and reference lists.Instrument Selection.— Instruments used at least once to rate the quality of Web sites providing
health information with their rating criteria available on the Internet.Data Extraction.— The name of the developing organization, Internet address, rating criteria,
information on the development of the instrument, number and background of
people generating the assessments, and data on the validity and reliability
of the measurements.Data Synthesis.— A total of 47 rating instruments were identified. Fourteen provided
a description of the criteria used to produce the ratings, and 5 of these
provided instructions for their use. None of the instruments identified provided
information on the interobserver reliability and construct validity of the
measurements.Conclusions.— Many incompletely developed instruments to evaluate health information
exist on the Internet. It is unclear, however, whether they should exist in
the first place, whether they measure what they claim to measure, or whether
they lead to more good than harm.},

For a hypertextual argument to succeed, it should clearly employ the fundamentals of giving good reasons and ample evidence. But such an essay should also deal with the loss of control over order by making use of recent developments in rhetoric and argument theory. Specifically, I present concepts of informal logic, stasis theory, primacy/recency/repetition effects, spatial metaphors, and textual coherence as a starting point for building a rhetorical understanding of argumentation strategies in hypertext.},

The different professions are contributing to and influencing the developments in KM in their own ways. However, it is argued here that IS is not contributing to the advancement of KM as much as it should for a number of apparent reasons. The main purpose of the paper is to call on the members of the IS profession to take a more proactive and visible role in advancing KM by showing that KM is a natural and long-awaited development in IS and that a number of circumstances have made KM to be an area of emphasis in IS whose time has come. The paper also aims at contributing towards achieving a consensus among IS professionals on conceptualization, goals, and scope of KM in IS. The recommendations of the paper focus on how the profession could proactively be involved in advancing KM.},

	abstract = {Abstract This article offers preliminary insights and a possible empirical model for managing the conceptual, methodological, and technological challenges entailed in developmental analysis of link-mediated relations. We offer a "mid-range" approach to making sense of linking practices, midway between close rhetorical/ethnographic analysis of links and large-scale link mapping. We suggest that systematic human coding and interpretation of linked-to producer types affords a more concrete and specific basis for hypothesizing about linking strategies than machine mapping, while providing a more robust attempt to generalize across the universe of candidate Web sites than ethnographic analysis. To illustrate this two-pronged approach to link analysis, we examine the linking practices exhibited on Web sites produced by U.S. Congressional candidates during the 2002 campaign season, focusing on the extent and development of links from candidate Web sites to other types of political Web sites during the three months prior to the November, 2002 election.},

LibX also includes an autolinking feature, which embeds searchable links within other Web sites such as Google, Amazon, or Yahoo. Zotero merges the best features of other citation management programs with those of popular Web 2.0 services. Zotero users can store full citation information and sort, tag, annotate, and search these citations from within the Firefox browser. Zotero can also “scrape” citations from certain Web sites, allowing users to selectively save citations into their research collection. Zotero can generate complete bibliographies in MLA, APA, and Chicago styles. The abilities to remotely store, synchronize, and share Zotero collections are under development with a planned release date in fall 2007.},

	abstract = {The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States consisting of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The Congress meets in the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 Representatives and 100 Senators. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members in addition to its 435 voting members. These members can, however, sit on congressional committees and introduce legislation. These members represent Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency, known as a "district". Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators. Currently, there are 100 senators representing the 50 states. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.
To be eligible for election, a candidate must be aged at least 25 (House) or 30 (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the electing state when elected.
The Congress was created by the Constitution of the United States and first met in 1789, replacing in its legislative function the Congress of the Confederation. Although not constitutionally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party and only rarely to a third party or as independents.},

	abstract = {The second wave of the National Congregations Study (NCS-II) was conducted in 2006–07. The 2006 General Social Survey asked respondents who attend religious services to name their religious congregation. This new nationally representative cross-section of congregations was supplemented with a randomly selected sample of congregations who participated in the 1998 NCS. Data about these congregations was collected via a 45-minute interview with one key informant from 1,506 congregations. Information was gathered about multiple aspects of congregations' social composition, structure, activities, and programming. Approximately 60 percent of the NCS-II questionnaire replicates items from 1998. Each congregation was geocoded, and data from the 2000 United States census have been appended. This article describes NCS-II methodology, reports results from many of the variables measured in both waves, and highlights trends involving congregational use of computer technology, worship styles, clergy age, and the demographic composition of congregations and their neighborhoods.},
